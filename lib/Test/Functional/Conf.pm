=head1 NAME

Test::Functional::Conf - Run-time configure for Test::Functional

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # run extra "in-development" tests
  perl -MTest::Functional::Conf=unstable,1 some-test.t

  # stop at first test failure
  perl -MTest::Functional::Conf=fastout,1 some-test.t

  # find first test failure (including unstable tests)
  perl -MTest::Functional::Conf=fastout,1,unstable,1 some-test.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package's only function is to allow a user to toggle various modes of
Test::Functional. The synopsis provides the general idea. The specific features
that are currently available are:

=over

=item * unstable (boolean): run test which are under construction (signified by
using I<notest()> rather than I<test()>.

=item * fastout (boolean): halt the test at the first failure.

=back
